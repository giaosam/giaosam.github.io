These are my works in the course FNAR635 3D Computer Modeling. I explored modeling and rendering object, environment and character.

## Features
### Objects Modeling
There are an Android, a pair of glasses, a bulb, an axe and a recycling bin in the scene.

### Environment Modeling
This is a reading room modeled according to the one in the Li Wen Zheng Library at Southeast University.
