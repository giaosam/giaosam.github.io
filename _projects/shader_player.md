A Qt GUI based on OpenGL, with different vertex and fragment shaders written in GLSL to apply different coloration effects to the surfaces of 3D models. It also performs various post-processing effects on the scenes rendered by the surface shaders, with procedural noise functions added for some shaders to perform visual deformations and colorations.


## Features
