### 1. What is BSDF?

The [BSDF (bidirectional scattering distribution function)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function) is a superset and the generalization of the BRDF and BTDF.

#### 1.1 The BRDF

The BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) $f_r(p, \omega_o, \omega_i)$ is a function over pairs of directions $\omega_i$ and $\omega_o$ that describes how much incident light along $\omega_i$ is scattered from the surface in the direction $\omega_o$ at one point.

Given an incident radiance along the direction $\omega_i$, $L_i(p, \omega_i)$, the BRDF computes how much radiance is leaving the surface in the direction $\omega_o$ toward the viewer $L_o(p, \omega_o)$:

$$f_r(p, \omega_o, \omega_i) = \frac{dL_o(p, \omega_o)}{L_i(p, \omega_i)cos\theta_i d\omega_i}$$

Physically based BRDFs have two important qualities:

- *Reciprocity*:  

  For all pairs of directions $\omega_i$ and $\omega_o$, $f_r(p, \omega_o, \omega_i) = f_r(p, \omega_i, \omega_o)$.

- *Energy conservation*:

  The total energy of light reflected is less than or equal to the energy of incident light.

#### 1.2 The BTDF

The BTDF (bidirectional transmittance distribution function), which describes the distribution of transmitted light, can be defined in a manner similar to that for the BRDF. The BTDF is generally denoted by $f_t(p, \omega_o, \omega_i)$, where $\omega_i$ and $\omega_o$ are in opposite hemispheres around $p$. Remarkably, the BTDF does not obey reciprocity as defined above.

#### 1.3 Basic Reflection Models

Reflection from surfaces can be split into four broad categories: *diffuse*, *glossy specular*, *perfect specular*, and *retro-reflective*. Most real surfaces exhibit reflection that is a mixture of these four types.

- *Diffuse* surfaces scatter light equally in all directions. A perfectly diffuse surface isn’t physically realizable

  e.g. dull chalkboards, matte paint (near-diffuse surfaces).

- *Glossy specular* surfaces scatter light preferentially in a set of reflected directions—they show blurry reflections of other objects.

  e.g. plastic, high-gloss paint

- *Perfect specular* surfaces scatter incident light in a single outgoing direction.

  e.g. mirrors, glass

- *Retro-reflective* surfaces scatter light primarily back along the incident direction.

  e.g. velvet, the Earth’s moon

 It is common to split BRDF into diffuse, specular and glossy components:

### 2. Geometry of BSDF

Reflection computations are evaluated in the shading coordinate system, which is defined by the orthonormal basis vectors $tangent$, $bitangent$, $normal$ aligned with the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes, respectively. Directions vectors $\omega$ in world space are transformed into the shading coordinate system before any of the BRDF or BTDF methods are called.

![BSDF Pic5: Shading Coordinate](/assets/images/blogs/bsdf/shading_coordinate.jpg){: .align-center .zoom-75}  

Given a direction vector $\omega$, it is easy to compute cosine and sine of angles in the above image, for example:

$cos\theta = (normal \cdot \omega) = ((0, 0, 1) \cdot \omega) = \omega_z$

#### 2.1 Transform vectors between world and local

Given vectors $tangent$, $bitangent$, $normal$ in world space, the matrix $M$ that transforms vectors from the world coordinate to the local coordinate is:

$ M = \begin{bmatrix} & tangent.x & tangent.y & tangent.z \newline
& bitangent.x & bitangent.y & bitangent.z \newline
& normal.x & normal.y & normal.z  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} tangent \newline bitangent \newline normal \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} t \newline b \newline n \end{bmatrix}$

It's easy to verify the correctness of $M$: $Mn = (t \cdot n, b \cdot n, n \cdot n)$, because $t\perp n$ and $b \perp n$, and $n$ is normalized so $n \cdot n = 1$. Therefore, $Mn = (0, 0, 1) = n$, as expected.

The transposed matrix $M^T$ can take vectors back from the local coordinate to the world coordinate.

#### 2.2 Geometric Normal VS Shading Normal

Geometric normal $n_g$ is defined by the surface geometry, i.e., it's the normal of a triangle of the mesh, while shading normal $n_s$ is given by per-vertex normals or bump mapping (for more information please refer this [answer](https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/5486/whats-the-difference-between-geometric-surface-normal-and-shading-surface-norma) on Stack Overflow).



### 3. Implementation of BSDF

#### 3.1 The Interface of BSDF: ```BxDF```

BRDFs and BTDFs share a common base class, ```BxDF```, which describes a specific way to scatter light. Each ```BxDF``` has a ```BxDFType``` member, which holds flags representing categories of reflection and/or transmission this ```BxDF``` has, and the flags should have at least one of ```BSDF_REFLECTION``` or ```BSDF_TRANSMISSION``` set and exactly one of the diffuse, glossy, and specular flags.

Key class member functions (please refer to [bsdf.cpp](https://github.com/giaosame/Path-Tracer/blob/master/main/src/scene/materials/bsdf.cpp) for more implementation details):

- ```BxDF::f()```

  Returns the value of the distribution function for the given pair of directions. It's a pure virtual function in the implementation.

  In addition, not all ```BxDF```s can be evaluated with the f() method, perfectly specular objects only scatter light from a single incident direction into a single outgoing direction. Such ```BxDF```s are best described with delta distributions that are zero except for the single direction where light is scattered.

- ```BxDF::Sample_f()```

  Computes the direction of incident light $\omega_i$ given an outgoing direction $\omega_o$, and returns the value of the bidirectional scattering distribution for the chosen direction as well as the sampled direction and pdf.

  The default implementation of Sample_f() generates a uniformly random sample as the incident direction $\omega_i$. However, for delta distributions, Sample_f() has to choose a specific incident light direction.

#### 3.2 The ```BSDF``` Class

The ```BSDF``` class represents a collection of BRDFs and BTDFs. The ```BSDF``` class holds a set of ```BxDF``` whose contributions are summed to give the full scattering function.

Key class member functions (please refer to [bsdf.cpp](https://github.com/giaosame/Path-Tracer/blob/master/main/src/scene/materials/bsdf.cpp) for more implementation details):

- ```BSDF::f()```

  Computes the f() of all of the matched ```BxDF```s belonging to this ```BSDF```, and returns the sum of these f()s.

  In details, first convert the given incident direction $\omega_i$ and the outgoing direction $\omega_o$ from world space to local space, and then use the local $\omega_i$ and $\omega_o$ to determine whether they are in the same hemisphere when computing f().

- ```BSDF::Pdf()```

  Computes the average probability density function (pdf) of all ```BxDF```s that match the given ```BxDFType```.

- ```BSDF::Sample_f()```

  Use the given random number to select one of the ```BxDF```s which matches the given ```BxDFType``` flags. Then, sample an incident direction $\omega_i$ with the ```BxDF::Sample_f()``` of the selected ```BxDF```. Finally, use ```BSDF::f()``` and ```BSDF::Pdf()``` to compute the total value of BSDF and average pdf of the sampled $w_i$.

**Where to use BSDF?**

The surface shader is represented by an instance of the ```Material``` interface class, which has a method that takes a point on a surface and creates a ```BSDF``` object that represents scattering at the point.

**Determine reflection or transmission when evaluating the BSDF**

If $w_i$ and $w_o$ lie in the same hemisphere with respect to the geometric normal, we evaluate the BRDFs, and otherwise we evaluate the BTDFs. $\omega_i$ and $\omega_o$ lies in the same hemisphere if $(\omega_i \cdot n_g) * (\omega_o * n_g) > 0$ ($\omega_i, \omega_o, n_g$ are vectors in the world space).
